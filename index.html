                    <h2>Band History</h2>
             <p> The Monkees are a American rock pop band that were originally concieved in 1965 and became active from 1966 up to present day. Our band originally consisted of Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Davy Jones. We released multiple songs and albums throughout the years from 1965 to 2018 and split up and reunited multiple times during that time. We were inspired by the Beetles and got to meet them when we visited them in England. We made appearances on television which included a television series and performed at various events and shows. We were one of the early pioneers of the music video format according to music historians and we paved the way for every boy band in our wake. Our last tour as was in 2016 called our 50th anniversary tour. Unfortunatly due to health reasons we had to cut the tour short but we plan on making up for the lost time.  <br> Today we still perform with remaining members Mikey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith and also do our own solo gigs.
              We continue to perform today and enjoy doing smaller gigs such as weddings for our fans.
